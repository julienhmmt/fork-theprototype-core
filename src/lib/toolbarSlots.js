// 42 I9 — THE TWO STACKS CONTROLS DOES NOT DRAW ITSELF, published for the components that do.
//
// The toolbar's layout record (`controlsLayout`, $lib/toolbarLayout) places buttons in five
// regions. Controls.svelte draws the bar and the two bottom corners; the TOP-RIGHT group is
// Users.svelte's (notes, the notifications bell, the peers trigger and their panels) and the
// TOUCH TOOLS are TouchTools.svelte's (undo / redo / multi-select beside the logo). Those two
// keep drawing their own NATIVE buttons — the panels hang off them — and read here which of them
// are placed, in what order, and whether Edit positions is running (then Controls draws the whole
// region's placeholders in their place, and any OTHER roster button placed there, through a
// display:contents wrapper portaled into the group).
//
// A LEAF (svelte/store only). Controls is the one writer; the defaults are what a fresh profile
// and the server-rendered page show, so hydration never has to reconcile two answers.
