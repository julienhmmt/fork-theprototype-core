	// #20 P4: the touch-tools cluster — round Undo / Redo / Multi-select buttons beside
	// the logo, matching its 48px chrome and dropping below the Connect bar with it.
	//
	// Why these three and not more: touch has no keyboard and no right-click, so Ctrl+Z
	// and Shift-click are the two reflexes a phone user simply cannot perform. Everything
	// else already has a touch path (the long-press viewport menu, the + button).
	//
	// MULTI-SELECT is one toggle covering both gestures a modifier would have covered —
	// a tap ADDS instead of replacing, and a drag on empty space draws the marquee — so
	// there is one thing to learn and one mode to see. Scene.svelte reads
	// `multiSelectMode` in the same two places it reads `event.shiftKey`, which is what
	// keeps this from being a second selection implementation.
